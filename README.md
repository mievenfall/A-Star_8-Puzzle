# A-Star_8-Puzzle
CS 4200 - Artificial Intelligence Project 1

This program implements the A* search algorithm to solve 8-puzzle problems.

## Description
The 8-puzzle is a puzzle consisting of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one blank space. The goal is to rearrange the tiles from some random starting state into the goal state with the tiles placed in order.

This program performs the A* search algorithm to find the optimal solution path from the start state to the goal state. It uses the number of misplaced tiles as the heuristic to guide the search.

## Usage
To use the program:

- Navigate to the /src directory
- Run python main.py
- Follow the prompts to enter the start state and select algorithm parameters
- The program will output the solution path if found
